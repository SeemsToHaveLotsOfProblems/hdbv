## How to Add Badges
    * In the Add Badge menu you may choose an image to add as a badge.
    * You files name will be the name of the badge.
    Example:
        "The Add Badge Badge.png" will add a badge called "The Add Badge Badge" to the chosen season.
        The file name is the badges name, so "the_add_badge_badge.png" Will show in lowercase with the underscores.
